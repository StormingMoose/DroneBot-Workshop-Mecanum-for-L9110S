# DroneBot-Workshop-Mecanum-for-L9110S
Altered Bill's software to work on the Meccano Mecanum car with L9110S motor drivers.

The mec-robot-remote is unchanged and only here for convenience.

Neo Pixels can be added but I did not have any and the car drives fine without them.

Use the Android 1.8.19 IDE to flash the TTGO, 2.03 did not want to cooperate.
